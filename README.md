<p>Galacticolour is a web-based, two-dimensional space shooter which takes inspiration from classic
games such as Asteroids and Space Invaders, along with a touch of the beloved mobile game Color Switch.</p>

<p>The objective of Galacticolour is to complete a series of 14 levels, where the player traverses the galaxy from 
planet to planet fighting off waves of increasingly stronger enemies.</p>

<p>Change the appearance and functionality of your equipment including ship body types, projectiles and engines. </p>

<p>This project was developed in a team of 3 group members.</p>
